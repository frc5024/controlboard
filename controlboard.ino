 *
 * Team 5024's Arduino-based DriverStation control board source code.
 *
 * This software is designed to run on an Arduino Leonardo. It will register
 * itself with a host computer as a standard HID joystick. This joystick can be
 * read by FRC DriverStation software, and can be used in FRC robot code with
 * the help of Lib5K's frc.lib5k.interface.controlboard package.
